** Receipes Search Application

Overview:
This React application allows users to search for recipes based on their ingredients. The list of recipes is filtered dynamically as the user types in the search box.

Features:
1. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for recipes by ingredients. The search term is matched against the ingredients of each recipe.
2. **Performance Optimization with useMemo**: The app uses the `useMemo` hook to prevent unnecessary re-computation of the filtered recipes. It only recalculates the filtered recipes when the search term changes.
3. **Dynamic Recipe List**: Recipes are displayed based on the search input. If no recipes match, a message indicating that no recipes were found is shown.

How it Works:
1. **State**: 
   - `search`: Stores the current search input typed by the user.
   - `filterReceipes`: Contains the filtered list of recipes based on the search input. This is computed using `useMemo` to ensure efficient filtering.
   
2. **Filtering**:
   - The recipes are filtered based on the ingredients. Each recipe's ingredients are checked to see if any of them contain the search term.
   - The `useMemo` hook ensures that the filtering process only runs when the `search` value changes, improving performance.

3. **Rendering**:
   - If there are matching recipes, they are displayed with their name and ingredients.
   - If no recipes match the search input, a message is shown informing the user that no recipe was found.


Usage:
- Type an ingredient into the search field to filter the recipes.
- If you type a common ingredient (e.g., "cheese"), the list will show all recipes containing "cheese" in their ingredients.

Note:
- This app uses static data (`dummyData`) for the recipes. You can modify the data to add more recipes or integrate it with an external API for dynamic data.

Enjoy using the recipe search app!

** Todo Lists.jsx
To-Do List Application

Overview:
This React application allows users to manage a to-do list. Users can add tasks, filter them by completion status (All, Completed, Active), and remove tasks.

Features:
1. **Task Creation**: Users can add tasks by typing into the input field and pressing the Enter key.
2. **Task Filtering**: Users can filter tasks based on their completion status (All, Completed, Active).
3. **Task Completion Toggle**: Users can toggle the completion status of tasks by clicking the checkbox next to each task.
4. **Task Removal**: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking the Remove button.

How it Works:
1. **State**: 
   - `value`: Tracks the text input for new tasks.
   - `lists`: Stores the list of tasks, each with an `id`, `text`, and `isCompleted` status.
   - `filter`: Stores the selected filter type ('All', 'Completed', 'Active').

2. **Filtering**:
   - The `useMemo` hook is used to filter the tasks based on the selected filter option (`filter` state). It returns:
     - All tasks if the filter is 'All'.
     - Only completed tasks if the filter is 'Completed'.
     - Only active tasks if the filter is 'Active'.

3. **Task Creation**:
   - A new task is added by pressing the Enter key. The task is only added if the input is not empty.
   - The task is added with an `id` generated from the current timestamp to ensure uniqueness.

4. **Task Completion Toggle**:
   - Clicking on the checkbox next to a task toggles its `isCompleted` status.

5. **Task Removal**:
   - Clicking the "Remove" button next to a task removes that task from the list.

Usage:
- Add tasks by typing them in the input field and pressing Enter.
- Filter tasks by selecting one of the filter options (All, Completed, Active).
- Toggle the completion status by clicking the checkbox.
- Remove tasks by clicking the Remove button.

Note:
- The tasks are stored in the `lists` state and can be filtered based on the completion status. The app does not persist data after a page refresh (you can extend it to save tasks to localStorage or a backend if needed).

Enjoy using the To-Do List application!

**Expenses.jsx
# Expenses Tracker React Application

This is a simple React application to track expenses. Users can add expenses, categorize them, and filter by category. It also displays the total expense.

## Key Features:
- **Add Expenses**: Users can input the amount and category of the expense, which gets added to the list.
- **Filter Expenses**: Users can filter the expenses by category (e.g., All, Transport, Food, Others).
- **Total Expenses**: The total sum of all expenses is displayed dynamically.

## Main Components:

1. **State Variables**:
   - `expenseData`: Stores the current input for amount and category.
   - `expenses`: Stores the list of all expenses added.
   - `filter`: Tracks the current filter category ("All", "Transport", "Food", "Others").

2. **useMemo**:
   - `filterExpenses`: This is a memoized value that returns the filtered list of expenses. It only recomputes the filtered expenses when the `filter` or `expenses` array changes.
   - `totalExpense`: This is a memoized value that calculates the total of all expenses in the `expenses` array. It recomputes the total whenever the `expenses` array is updated.

3. **Functions**:
   - `handleChange`: Updates the input fields (`amount` and `category`) when the user types or selects a value.
   - `handleAddExpense`: Validates the input and adds a new expense to the `expenses` list. It also clears the input fields after adding the expense.

4. **UI Elements**:
   - Input fields for entering the amount and selecting a category.
   - A button to add the expense.
   - A filter menu to choose the category of expenses to display.
   - A list displaying the filtered expenses.
   - The total sum of expenses is displayed at the bottom.

## Explanation of Key Hooks:

- **useState**: This hook is used to manage the state of various variables (`expenseData`, `expenses`, `filter`).
  
- **useMemo**: This hook optimizes the filtering of expenses and the calculation of the total expense by memoizing the values. It only recomputes the result when the relevant dependencies (either `filter` or `expenses`) change. This prevents unnecessary recalculations on every render.

## Conclusion:
The app is designed to be simple and efficient for tracking expenses by category. By using `useMemo`, the application is optimized to avoid unnecessary recalculations, making it more performant.
